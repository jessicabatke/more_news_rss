# more_news_rss
Manually scraping the few sites I can't get through their own RSS or Google News

To add more sites, open the .py file and add to the dictionary at the top.  You'll also need to check the source code and modify the scrape() function accordingly.

Outputs to 
"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jessicabatke/more_news_rss/main/" + name_of_feed
e.g.: 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jessicabatke/more_news_rss/main/ap_china_feed.xml
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jessicabatke/more_news_rss/main/npr_china_feed.xml
etc
